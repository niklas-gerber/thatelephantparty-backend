# That Elephant Party - Backend API

A secure Node.js/Express backend for event management.

This fully containerized backend lets you publicly serve Static Page Content, a list of Events,
and a Ticket Purchase application that is tailored for payment through the popular
filipino e-Wallet GCash. After logging in Admins have full CRUD control over
tickets and events. A lambda function automatically closes ticketing if the deadline
is met. See details below. [Frontend publication is in the works and will follow 
around July 2025]

## Features
- **Authentication**: JWT controlled access  
- **Payments**: GCash payslip upload workflow (multer)  
- **Automation**: Lambda for ticket deadline handling  
- **Reporting**: PDF generation (attendees, accounting)  
- **Security**: Rate limiting, SQL injection protection, CSRF tokens  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM  
- **Storage**: Local/S3 file uploads for payslips/posters  
- **Logging**: Error Handling Middleware and Winston Logger with log rotation

## Setup
1. Clone repo
2. Create `.env` (see [.env.example](.env.example))
3. `docker-compose up --build` in /backend

## Application Details
Implementation of a trust-based payment process as a workaround for GCash's API restrictions:  
- Guests upload payslips after GCash transfer  
- Automated email confirmations  
- Admin verification backend  
- Each Email address and reference number is restricted to only one ticket purchase

Control access for admin:
- Ticket prices can be adjusted dynamically (for example tiers)
- optional bundle sale (bundlesize and bundleprice)
- door service can check registered guests in and out
- Door service can count walk-in ticket sales for central accounting
- Download financial report, email list of attendees and lists of attendees' names
